# Kolasys AI — Session Log

Running record of all build sessions: what was built, decisions made, and current state.

---

## Session 1 — 2026-04-03

**Machine:** Mac Studio  
**Goal:** Take the blank `create-next-app` scaffold to a complete Phase 1 foundation.

### What was built

**Full Phase 1 project scaffold — 34 files created or replaced.**

**Schema & config (4 files)**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — 11 models, 9 enums, Prisma v7 `prisma-client` provider, output to `src/generated/prisma`
- `.env.example` — 19 environment variable placeholders
- `next.config.ts` — S3 image patterns, `serverExternalPackages` for ioredis/bullmq
- `tsconfig.json` — `@/*` path alias mapped to `./src/*`

**Infrastructure libraries (6 files)**
- `src/lib/db.ts` — Prisma singleton (wrong constructor — fixed Session 2)
- `src/lib/redis.ts` — two IORedis clients (general + BullMQ-dedicated)
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — S3 upload, download, presigned URLs, delete
- `src/lib/queues.ts` — BullMQ queue definitions (transcription, summarization)
- `src/lib/trpc.ts` — `createTRPCReact<AppRouter>()` (missing `'use client'` — fixed Session 2)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — `cn`, `formatDuration`, `formatFileSize`, `slugify`, `relativeTime`

**tRPC API layer (4 files)**
- `src/providers/trpc-provider.tsx` — React Query + tRPC provider (client component)
- `src/server/trpc.ts` — tRPC init, context factory, procedure tiers
- `src/server/root.ts` — combined `appRouter` and `AppRouter` type
- `src/server/routers/recordings.router.ts` — recordings CRUD + upload flow

**Services (3 files)**
- `src/services/transcription.service.ts` — OpenAI Whisper wrapper with segment extraction
- `src/services/summarization.service.ts` — Anthropic Claude structured JSON output
- `src/services/meetingbot.service.ts` — Recall.ai REST client

**Workers (1 file)**
- `src/workers/transcription.worker.ts` — BullMQ: download → transcribe → persist → enqueue
- *(summarization.worker.ts not yet written — queue wired but nothing consuming it)*

**Components (3 files)**
- `src/components/status-badge.tsx` — enum-mapped coloured badge
- `src/components/browser-recorder.tsx` — MediaRecorder API component
- `src/components/new-recording-modal.tsx` — 3-tab modal (upload / record / bot)

**App pages (9 files)**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout with ClerkProvider + TRPCReactProvider
- `src/app/page.tsx` — root redirect
- `src/app/globals.css` — Tailwind v4 with `@theme {}`
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — sidebar + org switcher
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — overview stats
- `src/app/dashboard/recordings/page.tsx` — infinite scroll list
- `src/app/dashboard/recordings/[id]/page.tsx` — recording detail
- `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` — tRPC handler
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` — Clerk org/membership sync
- `src/app/api/webhooks/recall/route.ts` — Recall.ai bot events

**Auth proxy + seed + docs (9 files)**
- `src/proxy.ts` — Clerk middleware
- `prisma/seed.ts` — 4 built-in note templates
- `docs/` — README, SETUP, ARCHITECTURE, COMPLIANCE, PHASE1, PHASE2, SESSION_LOG

**Total: 34 files created or modified**

### Key decisions made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `src/` directory structure | Standard for larger Next.js apps; keeps config at root clean |
| Direct-to-S3 upload via presigned URLs | Vercel 4.5 MB body limit — presigned URLs bypass the server entirely |
| BullMQ + separate worker process | AI processing exceeds Vercel function timeout; workers run on Railway |
| Two Redis connections | BullMQ requires `maxRetriesPerRequest: null`; sharing one client would break general use |
| `fetchRequestHandler` for tRPC | Required for Next.js 16 App Router (not legacy `nextjs/adapter`) |
| `await params` everywhere | Next.js 16 breaking change: `params` and `searchParams` are Promises |
| Tailwind v4 CSS config | v4 uses `@theme {}` in CSS — no `tailwind.config.js` needed |
| `superjson` transformer | Handles Date, BigInt, undefined through tRPC automatically |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Best balance of quality/cost/speed for structured JSON output |
| `timingSafeEqual` for Recall.ai webhooks | Prevents timing attacks; uses built-in `crypto` module |
| `svix` for Clerk webhooks | Clerk's official library; handles header parsing + HMAC |

### Open questions at end of session

- [ ] Summarisation worker not written
- [ ] Root `app/` directory must be deleted (conflicts with `src/app/`)
- [ ] `svix` missing from `package.json`
- [ ] Prisma constructor API wrong in `db.ts`
- [ ] `'use client'` missing from `trpc.ts`

---

## Session 2 — 2026-04-04

**Machine:** Mac Studio  
**Goal:** Fix all Session 1 blockers, get end-to-end pipeline working.

### Setup

Configured AWS credentials in `.env`. Created S3 bucket `kolasys-ai-recordings` in `us-east-1`.

### Bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prisma v7 constructor | Used v6 `PrismaNeon(Pool)` API | `PrismaNeonHttp(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)` |
| 2 | Prisma enums in client components | Prisma uses Node.js APIs — crashes client bundle | Replace with local string union types |
| 3 | Missing `'use client'` in `trpc.ts` | `import type { AppRouter }` pulled Prisma into client bundle | Added `'use client'` as first line |
| 4 | Missing `server-only` guards | Server files could be accidentally imported client-side | Added to `server/trpc.ts`, `server/root.ts`, `db.ts`, `storage.ts` (db.ts/storage.ts reverted in Session 3) |
| 5 | Next.js 16 async `params` | `params` is now `Promise<{}>` | `const { id } = await params` in page + `generateMetadata` |
| 6 | Clerk catch-all routes | Clerk sub-routes need `[[...sign-in]]` folder structure | Moved to `[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` and `[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` |
| 7 | Next.js 16 middleware | Needed Clerk v7 import path | Updated to `@clerk/nextjs/server` |
| 8 | Legacy `app/` directory | Scaffold left root `app/` conflicting with `src/app/` | `rm -rf app/` |
| 9 | Missing `svix` | Clerk webhook handler imported svix but it wasn't installed | `npm install svix` |
| 9b | Port conflict + slow compile | Crashed process left port 3000 bound | `--port 3001` workaround; Turbopack warms up after 2–3 reloads |

### New: summarization.worker.ts

Written and tested. Flow: fetch transcript → load NoteTemplate → call Claude → save Note + NoteSection[] + ActionItem[] → status = READY.

### Milestone: First successful end-to-end test

Upload → S3 → Whisper → Claude → notes saved. All working on Mac Studio 2026-04-04.

### Open questions at end of session

- [ ] Configure `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + ngrok for org sync
- [ ] Configure `RECALLAI_API_KEY` + test meeting bot
- [ ] Real-time processing status polling (P1)
- [ ] Action items page (P1)
- [ ] Settings page (P1)
- [ ] Worker Dockerfile for Railway/Render (P1)

## Session 3 — 2026-04-06

**Machine:** Mac Mini (first time using this machine — fresh clone)  
**Goal:** Get running on Mac Mini, fix all P0/P1 issues, build Phase 2, deploy to Vercel.

### Mac Mini setup

1. Installed Node.js 22
2. `git clone https://github.com/kolasystems/kolasys-ai`
3. Copied `.env` from Mac Studio
4. `npm install && npx prisma generate`
5. Started workers — both crashed immediately → see Bug 10

### Bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `server-only` blocking workers | `db.ts` + `storage.ts` had `server-only`; throws outside Next.js bundler | Removed `server-only` from those two files |
| 11 | `$transaction` unsupported in HTTP mode | PrismaNeonHttp is stateless — can't hold transaction state | Sequential individual Prisma calls |
| 12 | `upsert` unsupported in HTTP mode | Not supported by HTTP adapter | `findUnique` → `create` or `update` |
| 13 | Nested writes (implicit transactions) | `{ segments: { create: [...] } }` = implicit transaction | Explicit parent create then `Promise.all(segments.map(...))` |
| 14 | Org FK constraint on first recording | Clerk webhook not configured locally; org row missing from DB | `orgProcedure` auto-provisions org from Clerk `auth()` context |
| 15 | `recordings.get` not org-scoped | Any authenticated user could read any recording by UUID | `recording.orgId !== ctx.orgId` check + `FORBIDDEN` error |
| 16 | S3 files never deleted | Deletion was in silent `try/catch` | Moved after transcript commit; errors logged explicitly |
| 17 | Worker env vars not loading | `process.env` empty in standalone `tsx` — Next.js injection doesn't apply | `import 'dotenv/config'` as first line in both workers |

### P0 audit completed

Full security and correctness audit. All 10 P0 items confirmed fixed. See `docs/PHASE2.md` for the audit list.

### Phase 1 — fully resolved

## Session 4 — 2026-04-06

**Machine:** Mac Mini  
**Goal:** Build iOS mobile app Phase 1 — all core screens, authentication, recording, and viewing notes.

### What was built

- **`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** — greeting, 3 stat cards, recent recordings, pull-to-refresh
- **`src/screens/RecordScreen.tsx`** — expo-av recording, permission handling, upload via tRPC, waveform animation
- **`src/screens/RecordingsScreen.tsx`** — searchable list, RecordingCard, navigate to detail
- **`src/screens/RecordingDetailScreen.tsx`** — Notes/Transcript/Actions tabs, polling while processing, share notes as Markdown
- **`src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`** — profile card, links, sign out
- **`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`** — bottom tabs + Recordings native stack
- **`src/components/`** — StatusBadge, RecordingCard, ActionItemRow, TranscriptSegment
- **`src/lib/trpc.tsx`** — tRPC React client, TRPCProvider, shared Recording/Note/ActionItem types

### Bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | JSI crash "expected dynamic type 'boolean'" | Native packages (safe-area-context 5.7, screens 4.24, gesture-handler 2.31) newer than SDK 54 expects | Downgraded to SDK 54 exact versions via `npx expo install --check` |
| 2 | Missing worklets | reanimated v4 requires `react-native-worklets` | `npx expo install react-native-worklets` |
| 3 | npm peer conflict | `@clerk/clerk-expo` pulls `react-dom`, conflicts with React 19.1 | Always use `--legacy-peer-deps` |
| 4 | Notes tab blank | Server returns `notes[]` array not `note` singular | Normalize: `rawData.note ?? rawData.notes?.[0] ?? null`; also patched server `recordings.get` to return `note` field |
| 5 | Infinite loading loop | `getToken` recreated each render → in `useCallback` deps → load re-ran forever | Store `getToken` in `useRef`; only `id` in deps |
| 6 | tRPC superjson silently dropping data | tRPC React hooks + superjson transformer discarded nested data | Replaced with direct HTTP fetch + manual response parsing |
| 7 | Microphone error on simulator | Simulator has no mic | `Constants.isDevice` check; contextual error message |

### State at end of session

- iOS app running in simulator (`npx expo run:ios`)
- All screens built and functional
- Notes, transcript, action items loading from production API
- Committed and pushed to `github.com/kolasystems/kolasys-ai-mobile`

## Session 5 — 2026-04-07

**Machine:** Mac Mini  
**Goal:** Mobile Phase 2 — Home Feed/Tasks/Calendar, topic outline, audio player UI, export sheet. Competitor research (Fireflies + PLAUD).

### Competitor research

Analyzed Fireflies.ai and PLAUD screenshots:
- **Fireflies:** Soundbites (shareable audio clips), AskFred AI chatbot Q&A on recordings, CRM integrations (Salesforce/HubSpot auto-log), Channels (team recording feed), transcript thread comments
- **PLAUD:** Hardware AI recorder pin, mind map export, shareable summary image cards, offline on-device transcription, multilingual auto-detect

### What was built

**`src/lib/api.ts`** (new) — extracted shared `trpcGet`/`trpcPost` helpers

**`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** (complete rewrite) — 3 internal tabs:
- **My Feed** — recordings grouped by this week / last week / older; status badge + notes-ready indicator
- **Tasks** — recordings with notes as collapsible sections; expand → lazy-load action items via `trpcGet`; checkbox toggle with API mutation
- **Calendar** — expo-calendar device events for today + 7 days; platform icon detection (Zoom/Meet/Teams); per-meeting bot-record toggle with Alert

**`src/screens/RecordingDetailScreen.tsx`** additions:
- Static 50-bar waveform visualization above transcript (seeded heights, not random)
- Disabled audio player UI (Play/Pause, −15s, +15s) — tapping shows "audio deleted after transcription" alert
- Topic outline — auto-detects sections from transcript (90s time gap or every 12 segments); shows timestamp + first-sentence title; tap to jump to page
- Export action sheet (bottom Modal): Share link (copy to clipboard), Copy Notes (Markdown), Copy Transcript, Export Notes TXT, Export Transcript TXT, Export Notes PDF (expo-print)

### Bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `FileSystem.cacheDirectory` not found | expo-file-system v19 moved legacy API | Import from `expo-file-system/legacy` |
| 2 | `useRef()` TS error | React 19 `useRef` requires initial value | `useRef(undefined)` |
| 3 | Export sheet busy state mismatch | Comparing `busy === action.icon` but storing label in busy | Added `id` field to each action, compare `busy === action.id` |

### State at end of session

- iOS app running with all new features
- Competitor research documented in web repo CLAUDE.md and docs
- Committed and pushed to `github.com/kolasystems/kolasys-ai-mobile`

### Feature roadmap additions from competitor research

| Feature | Priority | Based on |
|---|---|---|
| Ask AI / chatbot on recording | P0 | Fireflies AskFred |
| Smart search across note content | P1 | Fireflies |
| Shareable summary image card | P1 | PLAUD |
| CRM integration (Salesforce/HubSpot) | P2 | Fireflies |
| Transcript segment comments | P2 | Fireflies |
| Mind map export | P3 | PLAUD |
